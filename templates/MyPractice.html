    <h1>My Practice</h1>
    
    <p>I am a fully qualified integrative therapist. This means I am trained in a variety of different theories and can use the most helpful approach to meet your specific needs. I am person-centred meaning the sessions are client led, working with what you bring to the sessions. We may work psychodynamically exploring how your early experiences can influence your adult life. You may not be aware of this and part of the therapy is to bring this to your awareness, this in turn can enable change.  Listening to you, building a therapeutic relationship and working out what you want and need from therapy is at the heart of how I work. </p>
    
    <p>In the first session we meet and discuss the reasons why you have come to counselling. It is an opportunity to get to know each other and decide if we can work together. I usually meet with clients once a week at the same time and place, and work open-ended. This means the counselling lasts as long as it is needed. This can be short term or long term, with regular reviews to see how we are progressing. Also in the first session we go through a contract together, covering such things as confidentiality, cancellation policy etc. If we are both happy to continue after the first session I will ask you to sign the contract.</p>
