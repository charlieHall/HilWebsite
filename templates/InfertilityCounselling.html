    <h1>Infertility Counselling</h1>
    
    <p>My specialist area of work is Infertility and Involuntary Childlessness.</p>
    
    <p>Fertility treatment can be an intensely stressful experience and it is quite common to feel stressed while undergoing treatment. Some people find their feelings become more difficult and they may experience depression or anxiety. Counselling can help you process these difficult feelings in a safe and confidential setting. Whatever stage you are at, whether this is exploring your options, actually undergoing fertility treatment or trying to decide if you should stop treatment, you may feel this is the right time to seek counselling. I can offer you a safe space where you will be able to really consider your options and work out your right way forward.</p>
    
    <p>There are different types of Infertility Counselling:</p>
    
    <h2><u>Support Counselling</u></h2>
    
    <p>To provide emotional support at times of particular stress, such as when there has been a failure to become pregnant.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Therapeutic Counselling</u></h2>
    
    <p>To help deal with the consequences of Infertility and the treatment and to help find a way forward, this may be coming to terms with childlessness.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Implication Counselling</u></h2>
    
    <p>To help make a decision about whether to proceed with donor assisted treatment and to understand the implications of any proposed treatment for them, their family and any child born as a result of this treatment.</p>
    
    <p>I am a member of the British Infertility Counselling Association; this is the only professional association for infertility counselling in the UK. I have undertaken specialist training with them and continue to update my knowledge. </p>
    
    <p>If you would like to speak to me about counselling for Infertility and Involuntary Childlessness please call me on: 0778 908 5297.</p><br>
